#summary Guide for contributing translated text for the game

= Introduction =

This page describes how to translate the text used in the
Java edition of Micropolis. This will allow Micropolis to be
played in any language.


= Details =

Micropolis (Java edition) reads translated messages from
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_resource_bundle Java resource bundles]. You can edit the resource files directly, if you know
how to do that, but starting with version 1.3 there is a built-in
tool to help you.

To begin working on translations:
 # Start Micropolis (Java edition), and select "Translation Tool" from the "Help" menu.
 # Click Add Locale, and enter the 2-letter language and/or country codes for the language you want to work on. The language code should be two *lowercase* letters, and the country code should be two *uppercase* letters.
 # You should now see a column for your language. Click on each cell and enter translated text.
 # Some of the strings are paths to graphics files, or are color codes. You probably should NOT translate these strings, so just leave the corresponding cells blank.
 # To try running Micropolis with the translated strings, click the *Test* button. This will launch a copy of Micropolis using the translated strings you entered.
 # When you are finished working on the language, click *Submit*. This will tell you what files you should upload so that the next version of Micropolis can include your strings.

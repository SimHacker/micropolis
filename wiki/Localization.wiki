= Introduction =

This page describes how to translate the text used in the
Java edition of Micropolis. This will allow Micropolis to be
played in any language.


= Details =

Micropolis (Java edition) reads translated messages from
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_resource_bundle Java resource bundles].

To begin working on translations:
 # Create a subdirectory named `micropolisj` in the directory containing  `micropolisj.jar`.
 # Go [https://code.google.com/p/micropolis/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fmicropolis-java%2Fstrings here] and download the properties files for the language whose translation you want to customize. If your language is not listed, download the core files (those without a language code). Save the files you downloaded to the `micropolisj` directory you created.
 # If your language was not listed, then rename the core files so that they have your language code in their name. For example, if the language is French (with code `fr`), then rename the core files to `CityMessages_fr.properties`, `CityStrings_fr.properties`, etc.

Working on translations:
 # Edit the various properties files using a plain text editor. Files should be saved using the Latin1 encoding.
 # To test the translation, open a command-prompt and launch Micropolis as follows:
     `java -cp ".:micropolisj.jar" micropolisj.Main`
 (if on Windows, use a semicolon (;) instead of a colon (:) for the -cp argument)

# Introduction #

## Foreword ##

Enter Micropolis and take control. Be the undisputed ruler of a
sophisticated real-time City Simulation. Become the master of existing
cities such as San Francisco, Tokyo, and Rio de Janeiro, or create
your own dream city (or nightmare slum) from the ground up.

Whether you take over an existing city or build your own, you are the
Mayor and City Planner with complete authority.

Your city is populated by Sims -- Simulated Citizens. Like their human
counterparts, they build houses, condos, churches, stores and
factories. And, also like humans, they complain about things like
taxes, mayors, taxes, city planners, and taxes. If they get unhappy,
they move out; you collect fewer taxes, the city deteriorates.

The next few sections will explain the overall concept of Micropolis and
give information that will help you win Scenarios and design and build
better cities.

## About System Simulations ##

Micropolis is the first of a new type of entertainment/educational
software, called System Simulations. We provide you with a set of
Rules and Tools that describe, create and control a system. In the
case of Micropolis the system is a city.

The challenge of playing a System Simulation game is to figure out how
the system works and take control of it. As master of the system, you
are free to use the Tools to create and control an unlimited number of
systems (in this case, cities) within the framework and limits
provided by the Rules.

### Rules ###

In Micropolis, the Rules to learn are based on city planning and
management, including:

  * Human Factors: Residential space and amenities, availability of jobs, and quality of life.

  * Economic Factors: Land value, industrial and commercial space, unemployment, internal and external markets, electric power, taxation, and funding for city services.

  * Survival Factors: Strategies for dealing with disasters, crime, and pollution.

  * Political Factors: Public opinion, zoning, and keeping residents and businesses satisfied with your city and your performance.

### Tools ###

The Tools provide you with the ability to plan, lay out, zone, build,
bulldoze, re-zone, and manage a city.

  * Plan: Mapping systems give physical and demographic overviews of the entire city.

  * Layout: Design living and working areas, road and transit systems, and recreational areas.

  * Zone: Set zoning boundaries for parks, residential, commercial and industrial areas.

  * Build: Place roads, rails, airports, seaports, fire and police stations, sports stadiums, and power plants.

  * Bulldoze: Clear forests for city growth, build landfill along waterways, clear and re-zone developed areas.

  * Manage: Using the mapping and graphing systems, gather up-to-date information on traffic density, population trends, power grid status, pollution, crime, land value, police and fire department efficiency, and cash flow. Set the tax rate and funding levels for city services.

But the most important Tool of all is the Simulator itself. Test your
plans and ideas as you watch the city grow or shrink through the
immigration and emigration of industrious Simulated Citizens. Sims
will move in and build homes, hospitals, churches, stores and
factories in the zones you provide, or move out in search of jobs or a
better life elsewhere. The success of the city is based on the quality
of the city you design and manage.

### Simulator Reaction Time ###

The simulator is a very complex multi-tasking piece of software. It is
constantly performing many checks, calculations, and updates, as well
as keeping watch on the mouse and keyboard to respond to your demands.
When you load in a city, give the simulator some time to compile its
data and update the maps, graphs, population levels, etc. Some of the
other times when the simulator lags behind you are when powering zones
and updating the city services map after installing police and fire
stations.

## The Goals of Micropolis ##

There are many goals to be pursued and reached in Micropolis.

### Scenarios ###

Each of the eight included scenarios is actually a game in itself,
with an unlimited number of ways to win -- or lose.

Each Scenario is a city which is either the victim of horrible
planning or about to be the victim of a natural disaster. After you
load in a Scenario, you will have a limited amount of time to correct
or repair the problems. If you are successful, you will be given the
key to the city. If not, you may be ridden out of town on a rail.

If one strategy doesn't work, try another. There are a million stories
in each city, and you write them.

### Your Dream City ###

Perhaps the main goal of Micropolis is for you to design, manage and
maintain the city of your dreams.

Your ideal place to live may be a bustling megalopolis, lots of
people, lots of cars, tall buildings: high-energy, high density
living. Or it may be a small rural community, or a linked group of
small communities providing slow-paced country living.

As long as your city can provide places for people to live, work, shop
and play, it will attract residents. And as long as traffic,
pollution, overcrowding, crime or taxes don't drive them away, your
city will live.

# Getting Started #

## Micropolis Requirements ##

Micropolis requires an Intel processor running the Linux operating
system, with the X11 window system installed, a 16 bit deep color graphics display,
a kernel with the shared memory option enabled,
and at least 32 megabytes of memory. <p>

<h2>Micropolis Features</h2>

<h3>On-Line Help</h3>

You can get help on the Micropolis user interface, by pointing the mouse<br>
at anything mysterious, holding down shift, and clicking the left button.<br>
The Help window will pop up, giving instructions and useful hints on how<br>
to use the controls.<br>
<br>
<h3>Multiple Views</h3>

You can open up any number of animated city maps and editors at once.<br>
<br>
<h3>Pie Menus</h3>

Micropolis features pop up "pie menus" for quickly selecting city editing tools.<br>
Pie menus are radial menus with their choices in different directions,<br>
and they're very fast and efficient to use.<br>
Since you change editing tools quite often while building a city,<br>
you can save much time and effort by using the pie menu shortcuts<br>
instead of the moving back and forth to the tool pallet.

	<h2>What is Micropolis Eduverse?</h2>

	<p>
	    "<b>Micropolis</b>" is the name of the open source GPLv3
	    version of SimCity, the city simulation game originally
	    designed by Will Wright and published by Maxis /
	    Electronic Arts.
	</p>

	<p>
	    EA has generously relicensed the original SimCity classic
	    source code under the terms of the 
	    <a href="http://gplv3.fsf.org">Gnu General Public License, version 3</a>.
	    The source code is published on the
	    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/micropolis/">Micropolis City Simulator Google Code Project</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	    "<b>Micropolis Eduverse</b>" is a web based version of
	    Micropolis, being developed with an educational focus.
	</p>

	<p>
	    We are currently in the process of cleaning up, documenting and rewriting the code in C++.
	    We are now generating the
	    <a href="http://www.micropolisonline.com/static/doc/html/index.html">Micropolis Core Documentation</a>
	    from the comments in the code, with Doxygen! 
	    For example, here is the documentation for the

		<blockquote>
		    <p>
			Will Wright, the designer of SimCity, SimEarth, SimAnt, and other popular games from Maxis, gave a talk at Terry Winnograd's user interface class at Stanford, in 1996 (before the release of The Sims in 2000). At the end of the talk, he demonstrated an early version of The Sims, called Dollhouse at the time. I attended the talk and took notes, on which this article elaborates. I was fascinated by Dollhouse, and subsequently went to work with Will Wright at Maxis for three years. We finally released it as The Sims in 2000, after several name changes: TDS (Tactical Domestic Simulator), Project-X (everybody has one of those), Jefferson (after the president, not the sitcom), happy fun house (or some other forgetable Japanese placism).
		    </p>
		    <p>
			At the talk, he reflected on the design of simulators and user interfaces in SimCity, SimEarth, and SimAnt. He demonstrated several of his games, including his current project, Dollhouse. [Later released as The Sims, becoming the top selling PC game of all time.]

		<blockquote>
		    <p>
		        At Will Wright's talk for Terry Winnograd's User Interface class in 1996:
		    </p>
		    <blockquote>
		        There was some interesting discussion about using SimCity as a medium for story telling: encouraging people to imagine far beyond the bounds of what the computer is able to simulate. You can build cities to empathise with, and tell stories about them, about their people, culture, buildings, and history. A class of students could label different parts of a city, and each person could tell a story about a different part, that interacted with the stories going on in neighboring parts of the city. Then they could make a web site with the downloadable city, and an image map of the whole city, linking to all the stories on web pages, with screen snapshots of their neighborhoods, and lots of hypertext links between each story. This way each student could colaborate with several others to write a web of interconnected stories, all about the same city!
		    </blockquote>
		    <p>
		        That pretty well sums up what The Sims Exchange is all about -- like a specialized blog built around a simulation game with built-in storytelling and content creation tools, for publishing stories as well as live downloadable user created game content:

Earlier, I had developed a multi player version of SimCity, which runs on Linux/X11, and was scriptable in TCL. Educators and researchers from Columbia University, MIT, IBM, Xerox and other educational and commercial institutions were excited about gaining access to this version of SimCity, and adapting it to teach and stimulate students' interest in urban planning, computer simulation and game programming.

		    <p>
		        Before I went to Maxis to work on The Sims with Will Wright, I worked at Interval Research. I saw the research and work that Brenda Laurel was doing on games for girls, before Purple Moon spun off from Interval. I found it very interesting and enlightened, and hoped it would be successful. It's illuminating to compare the two approaches, and I think this article makes some great points by doing that.

	<h2>Micropolis Eduverse Development Plan</h2>

	<p>
	    We have a realistic roadmap and sound appropriate open
	    source technology for developing an open, educationally
	    focused, online version of SimCity.
	</p>

	<p>
	    The first stage of the plan is to hook more of the
	    simulator up to the web server, and write an AJAX user
	    interface with city controls, drawing tools, overlays,
	    historical graphs and information visualizations,
	    resulting in a fully playable web based game.
	</p>

	<p>
	    This <a href="/micropolisView">proof of concept</a>
	    demonstrates the feasability of the plan, the maturity and
	    flexability of the software, and the possibility of
	    supporting the animation frame rate that Micropolis
	    requires for smooth interactivity over the Internet.
	</p>

	<p>
	    The scrolling tile view is implemented as an OpenLaszlo
	    component running in the Flash player, and is supported on
	    the server by Python and C++ code. It represents the most
	    complex and performance intensive piece of client/server
	    technology reqired to implement the user interface. Most
	    of the rest of the user interface is straightforward
	    graphics design, information visualization, widget layout
	    and AJAX web services.
	</p>

	<p>
	    After the basic game is playable over the web, the next steps are
	    to develop a multi player web based interface, chat, shared
	    whiteboard, text annotation, social networking, collaboration,
	    campaigning and voting dialogs, blogging and city newspaper
	    publishing tools, city and story sharing libraries, educational
	    courseware, support for teachers' requirements to use SimCity
	    effectively in the classroom, like xml and spreadsheet data
	    import/output to support science lab experiments and data analysis
	    (for teaching science and math using a game as motivation),
	    creative storytelling tools (using events in the game to stimulate
	    discussion and break writer's block), player created artwork,
	    tiles, sprites, avatars, skins and plug-ins, etc.

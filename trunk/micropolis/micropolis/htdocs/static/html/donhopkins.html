	<h2>Don Hopkins</h2>

	<p>
	    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Hopkins">Don Hopkins</a>
	    has worked with the SimCity source code for 16
	    years, ported to code to numerous platforms, and
	    developed a colaborative multi player user
	    interface to SimCity. He is committed to a long
	    term vision of developing an open source
	    educational software platform, and has written
	    about his own and other peoples ideas on his
	    <a href="http://www.DonHopkins.com">web site</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	    He deeply appreciates the power of games to inspire and
	    motivate kids to learn. As a high school student, he
	    started using the ARPANET in 1982 to play Zork at the
	    MIT-AI lab, and the orignal MUD (Multi User Dungeon) at
	    Essex University. Those experiences motivated him to learn
	    Lisp, Logo, Macsyma, Emacs and network programming, and
	    exposed him to the work of Marvin Minsky, Seymoure Papert,
	    Hal Abelson, Richard Stallman and Alan Kay. 
	</p>

	<p>
	    Don enjoys writing fun exemplary software like games and
	    user interfaces, that people can learn from and build on
	    top of. The first educational game software he developed
	    was a Logo version of "Adventure", which Terrapin Software
	    shipped with the Commodode-64 version of Logo as an
	    example of list processing.
	</p>

	<p>
	    Mark Weiser and Ben Shneiderman gave him the opportunity
	    to learn user interface design and network programming at
	    the University of Maryland Human Computer Interaction
	    Lab. There he developed pie menus, hypermedia browsers and
	    authoring tools, visual programming languages, extensibile
	    scripting languages, and encountered SimCity.
	</p>

	<p>
	    James Gosling recruited him to work on the
	    PostScript-based NeWS window system at Sun Microsystems,
	    where he developed an Open Look user interface toolkit, an
	    extensible tabbed window manager with pie menus,
	    distributed object oriented applications, and multimedia
	    programming examples like Pizzatool.
	</p>

	<p>
	    Will Wright trusted him to port SimCity to Unix, redesign
	    the user interface and implement a networked multi player
	    version of the game, which he demonstrated at INTERCHI'93
	    in Amsterdam, and shipped as a commercial product.
	</p>

	<p>
	    Will Wright later hired him into Maxis/Electronic Arts, to
	    work on his core team that developed and shipped The Sims
	    (the top selling PC game of all time). He designed and
	    implemented the character animation system, content
	    pipeline, user interface, visual programming and content
	    creation tools.
	</p>

	<p>
	    After shipping The Sims, he worked as a contractor for
	    Electronic Arts, developing easy-to-use tools to enable
	    players to create their own Sims content, working on the
	    Sims character animation tools, porting The Sims Online
	    server to Linux. 
	<p>
	    Will Wright subsequently contracted him to work for his personal
	    development lab, the Stupid Fun Club, programming robot brains,
	    character simulation, talking toy prototypes, speech synthesis tools,
	    and designing and developing software for reality TV productions and
	    patent applications.
	</p>

	</p>
	    Don Hopkins has written ambitious but realistic and successful proposals for EA to
	    "<a href="http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/node/16">Develop Third Party Content Authoring Tools for The Sims</a>"
	    (which led to the thriving Sims player created content community),
	    and to develop
	    "<a href="http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/node/24">Educational Multi Player SimCity for Linux</a>"
	    (which led to EA releasing Open Source SimCity under GPLv3 for the OLPC).
	</p>

	<p>
	    He has demonstrated Multi Player SimCity at ACM's InterCHI
	    Conference, IBM's New Paradigms Workshop, the
	    Exploratorium's Multimedia Playground, Interval's Electric
	    Carnival, BayCHI at Xerox PARC, and MIT Media Lab's
	    corporate sponsors meeting. Audiences are consistently
	    excited about the possibilities of using SimCity
	    educationally.
	</p>

	<p>
	    The "Open Sourcing" of SimCity makes the Micropolis
	    Eduverse project possible and practical. Most of the hard
	    work has already been done, and a playable online game is
	    now low hanging fruit, easily attainable with open source
	    technology, as this
	    <a href="/micropolisView">proof of concept</a>
	    demonstrates.
	</p>

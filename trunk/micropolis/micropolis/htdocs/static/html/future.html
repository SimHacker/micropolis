	<h2>Future of Micropolis (SimCity)</h2>

	<p>
	    Now that it's GPL, the Micropolis code can be ported to
	    many different systems, including Linux, Mac, and Windows
	    guis, as well as web servers and embedded devices! And it
	    can be improved and extended to make it a better
	    educational tool and open source programming example.
	</p>

	<p>
	    To that end, Hopkins has stripped down and cleaned up the original
	    code, repackaged it as modular C++ classes, integrated it with
	    Python as an extension module, using the SWIG interface generator
	    tool, which makes it possible to integrate SimCity with many other
	    languages like Java, Ruby or Lua as well as Python.
	</p>

	<p>
	    The plan is to build an exemplary open source game development
	    example, out of modular reusable components, that other people can
	    learn from, build on top of, re-use pieces of, integrate with
	    other languages, and use as a starting point for their own
	    projects.
	</p>

	<p>
	    The newly renovated version of Micropolis running on this
	    web server is tightly integrated with Python, so it is very
	    efficient, but still flexible, extensible, and modular.
	</p>

	<p>
	    The advantage to packaging Micropolis as a Python module
	    is that other Python programs (like a web server or gui)
	    can easily import it, customize it by subclassing, create
	    any number of indepedent simulator objects, control and
	    script the simlations, and integrate them with other
	    modules.

			Don and Alan have been having a great discussion about Robot Odyssey, which I'd like to share with the list. By coincidence, a discussion in #sugar today around SimCity's open sourcing turned to how to get Robot Odyssey onto the laptops... so I'd like to open the discussion to a wider audience.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Who is interested in helping develop a R.O. port, and in improving on the old implementation? Alan has some excellent ideas about how to turn the updating of the design into a useful exercise, perhaps for an eager coder or class.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Of course other nifty project ideas are more than welcome.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Don and Alan -- I think the entirety of your discussions about simulation and game design are worth sharing; if you don't mind, I'll transcribe some of them to the wiki for further elaboration.

			Thanks SJ --

			We are benefiting here from Don Hopkins' generosity (and of the original designers and owners of these games).
		    </p>
		    <p>
			The basic notion is that there are many games that, if modularized with nice separable interfaces, would be great environments for exploring various kinds of "learning by doing". For example, there is a nice separation between the "rules/dynamics" of a games world and the "strategies/actions" of the characters. There could be a third separation to break out the graphics and sound routines as a media environment.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			For example, in SimCity, the first and most useful breakout for children would be to allow various UIs to be made that would let children find out about and try experiments with the "city dynamics rules". It's not clear what the best forms for this would be, so it would be great to have a variety of different designers supply modules that would try to bridge the gaps to the child users.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			This could work even for pretty young children (we helped the Open Magnet School set up Doreen Nelson's "City Building" curriculum in the third grade of the school and this was very successful -- a child controlled SimCity would have been wonderful to have).
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Maybe this separation could be set up via the D-bus so that separate processes written in any language the authors choose could be used. This would open this game up to different experiments by different researchers to explore different kinds of UIs and strategy languages for various ages of children. I think this would be really cool! We would all learn a lot from this and the children would benefit greatly.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			A trickier deal would be the world dynamics (I'm just guessing here, but Don would know). This is one of the really great things about SimCity -- it can really accommodate lots of different changes and stitch things together to make a pretty decent simulation without too many seams showing. (Given the machines this game originally ran on, many of the heuristics are likely to be a little patchy. Don has indicated as much.) I think doing a great world dynamics engine for games like SimCity would be really wonderful -- and could even be a thesis project or two.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Don has talked about doing the separations so that many new games can be made in addition to the variations.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Similarly, Robot Odyssey (one of the best games concepts ever) was marred by choosing a way to program the robots where the complexity of programming grew much faster than the functionality that could be given to the robots. This game was way ahead of its time.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Again, the idea would be do make a game in which environment, levels of challenge, and how the robots are programmed would be broken out into separate processes that a variety of gamers and researchers could do experiments in language and UI.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			One of the most wonderful possibilities about this venture is that it will bring together very fluent designers from many worlds of computing (more worlds than usually combine to make a game) in the service of the children. We should really try to pull this off!
		    </p>

		<blockquote>

		    <p>
			From: Alan Kay
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Don --
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Thanks very much for these references. I was not aware of either of them and both are very useful for helping think about some of the educational environment needs for the OLPC XO.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			When teaching science, we have the important conflict between empirical and model-based approach of modern science and the belief-based dogma of religion. This is particularly critical because there are too many important results in science for each and every one to be learned through personal experiment, and many require tools that are beyond most individuals and schools. So, most people including scientists contact science via reading and hearing about results rather than verifying the experiments themselves. Much worse, most children are taught science as a kind of hearsay catechism of "this is true and must be believed".
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Scientists escape to a large extent from simple belief by having done enough real experimentation, modeling building using mathematics that suggests new experiments, etc., to realize that science is more like map-making for real navigators than bible-making: IOW, the maps need to be as accurate as possible with annotations for errors and kinds of measurements, done by competent map-makers rather than story tellers, and they are always subject to improvement and rediscovery: they never completely represent the territory they are trying to map, etc.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Many of us who having been learning how to help children become scientists (that is to be able to think and act as scientists some of the time) have gathered evidence which shows that helping children actually do real science at the earliest possible ages is the best known way to help them move from simple beliefs in dogma to the more skeptical, empirically derived models of science.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			We also know from the last century of careful observation of children that they think in ways that are different from adults, and as Piaget pointed out, it is best to think of children as thinking beings in their own right rather than as "defective adults who have to be fixed by education". And, further, children themselves are not homogenous in their approaches to life and learning: they have different styles, reasons for why they want to do things, what kinds of play they prefer, and so forth. The adults in their culture are both explicitly and implicitly trying to get the children to be part of the culture, and the children are wired by nature to try to learn whatever this is. In our culture, this is quite confusing, since the adult culture is an admixture of many different approaches to the world and how it works and can be manipulated. Real science is in the back seat or not even in the cultural vehicle as far as most children and adults (including most teachers) and most of the surrounding media are concerned.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			My main concern over the years is how to help children and adults do the initial "real science" that can form the modern scientific stance towards knowledge that allows them to deal with the majority of science knowledge presented as claims they will encounter over the years.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			So, I'm very interested in how the children can be motivated and helped to observe nature in ways that give rise to the formation of guesses that can be modeled and compared against the observations and lead to further observations. This requires finding out: what motivates different kinds of children, what kinds of observations can be done and in what form, how children can do real modeling and mapping, etc. All this has to be done above thresholds for what "real" means for science and its modeling. These thresholds can be approached by analogies to what it means for children to do "real music", "real art", "real writing and reading", "real sports", etc.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Seymour Papert's background was in real mathematics and science, and he was able to combine these with important insights of Piaget to realize that children could learn certain kinds of powerful math quite readily, whereas other forms of mathematics would be quite difficult. A central realization was that (a) the differential geometry of vectors (Gauss was one of the parents of this perspective) fit very readily into how children thought about themselves in the world, and that (b) the computer could show this world graphically and also easily do the laborious integration of the differential equations to give children the deep hit of fundamental powerful ideas of vector calculus in forms they could recognize and use for their own ends. I still regard these insights by Seymour as among the top few of all time regarding what computers are really good for.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			My contribution to this was small, and amounted to adding in the ideas (a) that multiple independent objects (an idea derived from the early world of simulation) which children could program in the manner of LOGO would amount to a world of real children's mathematics that could model many kinds of ideas, including those of science (and of course all previous computer structures and old and new media), and (b) that the entire environment including the math/programming languages the children used were properly part of the user interface and had to be carefully designed.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			There is abundant evidence that helping children move from human built-in heuristics and the commonsense of their local culture to the "uncommonsense" and heuristic thinking of science, math, etc., is best done at the earliest possible ages. This presents many difficulties ranging from understanding how young children think to the very real problem that "the younger the children, the more adept need to be their mentors (and the opposite is more often the case)".
		    </p>
		    <p>
			If "children first!" is the rallying cry, then it makes sense to try to invent computer environments that use the very best ideas (and these are very hard to come up with). This is why the various groups that got interested in this romantic quest via early contact with Seymour have always been colleagues and never rivals. The hard to come by ideas for projects, representations, user interfaces, experiments, etc., have been freely traded back and forth. The notions of "thresholds below which is not worth going" have been jointly refined, etc. One of the parasitic difficulties is that computer environments, once made (with lots of effort and dedication) tend to form tribal bonds that are rather religious in nature. The amount of effort required plus the attendant religion makes it extremely difficult to take new insights and ideas and make brand new better environments for the children. The strong tendency is to use and reuse and incrementally expand the old environments.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			So, for young and youngish children (say from 4 to 12) we still have a whole world of design problems. For one thing, this is not an homogenous group. Cognitively and kinesthetically it is at least two groups (and three groupings is an even better fit). So, we really think of three specially designed and constructed environments here, where each should have graceful ramps into the next one.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			The current thresholds exclude many designs, but more than one kind of design could serve. If several designs could be found that serve, then we have a chance to see if the thresholds can be raised. This is why we encourage others to try their own comprehensive environments for children. Most of the historical progress in this area has come from a number of groups using each other's ideas to make better attempts (this is a lot like the way any science is supposed to work). One of the difficulties today is that many of the attempts over the last 15 or so years have been done with too low a sense of threshold and thus start to clog and confuse the real issues.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			I think one of the trickiest issues in this kind of design is an analogy to the learning of science itself, and that is "how much should the learners/users have to do by themselves vs. how much should the curriculum/system do for them?" Most computer users have been mostly exposed to "productivity tools" in which as many things as possible have been done for them. The kinds of educalearner does the important parts by themselves, and any black or translucent boxes serve only on the side and not at the center of the learning. What is the center and what is the side will shift as the learning progresses, and this has to be accommodated.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			OTOH, the extreme build it from scratch approach is not the best way for most minds, especially young ones. The best way seems to be to pick the areas that need to be from scratch and do the best job possible to make all difficulties be important ones whose overcoming is the whole point of the educational process (this is in direct analogy to how spo can do and learn only have a real payoff for them if they have a computer. For example, many areas of physical dynamics (e.g Galilean Gravity) can be explored and represented in a kind of differential model they can understand without using a computer at all. But for all but about 5%-8% of the kids just finding a good model is not enough of a payoff. However, if the model can be set into motion (in mathematical terms: the integration of the differential model) then many "pieces of art" of great interest to about 90% of the children can be easily made. These include various kinds of falling games (like Lunar Lander, shoot the monkey, etc.).
		    </p>
		    <p>
			As the children get more sophisticated, the black and gray boxes that scaffold what they are doing can be popped open and understand and modified. For example, "forward" (which moves an object in the direction of its "heading") is a black box initially, and very useful in that form. But there is a point when the children will be greatly aided by understanding that forward is just a vector addition and is a method made from a more fundamental idea. The underlying language for the system itself has to reveal itself as the same species as what the children have been learning. The analogy to how English is carefully used for different ages and the expanding range of ideas and expression is quite apt.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			One of the simplest rules of thumb for any kind of design that requires learning is George Miller's "7 plus or minus 2", which refers to an estimate of how many things can be given attention at one time by our limited human minds. Perspective, simplification, abstraction and duration can all be traded off in designs that try to help learners make progress without overwhelming them. In programming language design in a UI, especially for beginners, this is especially crucial because it is easy to go far beyond 9 newtance of gisting argues against forms that have more than one meaning. For example, many languages (going all the way back to the 50s) have decided that "=" should have a double (or triple) meaning, and that it is up to the programmers to simply deal with it. This is almost certainly a bad idea for children K-8 (and beyond). In the case of "=", even in a functional language, the difference is huge (between a functional relationship and a definition). A suitable "logical language" that used unification would be less ambiguous but introduces quite a bit of abstraction (likely too early).
		    </p>
		    <p>
			But, as the child gets closer to high school and the outside world, the QWERTY phenomenon starts to get more important. Many of the global standards are willy nilly and poor, but need to be pragmatically learned at some point. For example, it is relatively easy to get 10-11 year old children to do the real science and math to make a good simulation model of the 2nd order differential relationship. This is best done (so far) by using two accumulator addition (used to be called a DDA and goes back before Babbage). The trade-offs between this simple and deep way to think incrementally about what is going on and the standard algebraic way of thinking about "what's going on for all time all at once" are interesting and important.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Our view is that one should get the 5th graders to do this in the most powerful way for them (incremental addition). And then later (maybe in 8th grade) revisit this and see how the incremental approach can be turned into an algebraic perspective. Both ways of looking at this are important and powerful in their own ways. It is likely that educators are quite justified in making up useful non-standard representations for powerful ideas for any topic that would be helped by this for children below the age of 12. There are many other important reasons for introducing more powerful forms for dealing with ideas in early childhood, etc.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			So it seems to me that there is a lot of room for new and different ideas for children's environments for learning powerful ideas. They have to be above threshold and in the spirit of real science and mathematics. Two cautionary examples are Interactive Physics and SimCity.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			The first assumes that Newton was absolutely right and is a direct embodiment of Newtonian Dynamics and Cosmology. The users are restricted to paramerizing the internal dynamic models and cannot see them, question them, or change them. (For example, it is really important to be able to try an inverse cube law for gravity, etc.). This is most assuredly not in the spirit of science! It amounts to a dynamic bible. In order for this to be useful in real education, there has to be a lead up that derives the relationships in an empirical and mathematical form, and only then will the premises of IP be useful.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			SimCity is similar but more pernicious. It is a black box of "soft somewhat arbitrary knowledge" that the children can't look at, question or change. For example, SC gets the players to discover that the way to counter rising crime is to put in more police stations. Most anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, and economists would disagree violently. Alternate assumptions can't be tried, etc.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Both of these packages have won many "educational awards" from the pop culture, but in many ways they are anti-real-education because they miss what modern knowledge and thinking and epistemology are all about. This is why being "above threshold" and really understanding what this means is the deep key to making modern curricula and computer environments that will really help children lift themselves.

		    <p>
			From: Don Hopkins
			<br/>
			Subject: Robot Odyssey
		    </p>
		    <p>
			One thing I've always wanted to do is a re-make of Robot Odyssey, with the full power of a real programming language underneath it, and lots of cool toys for the robots to play with! That was such a powerful concept for a game!
		    </p>

		    <p>
			From: Alan Kay
			<br/>
			Subject: Robot Odyssey
		    </p>
		    <p>
			I actually argued with him [Will Wright] and Maxis for not making SimCity very educational. E.g. the kids can't open the hood to see the assumptions made by SimCity (crime can be countered by more police stations) and try other assumptions (raise standard of living to counter crime) etc. I've never thought of it as a particularly good design for educational purposes.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			However, I have exactly the opposite opinion of Robot Odyssey, which I thought was a brilliant concept when the TLC people brought it to me at Atari in the early 80s. (Rocky's Boots is pretty much my all time favorite for a great game that really teaches and also has a terrific intro to itself done in itself, etc. Warren Robinette is a very special designer.).
		    </p>
		    <p>
			The big problem with Robot Odyssey (as I tried to explain to them) was that the circuits-programming didn't scale to the game. They really needed to move to something like an object-oriented event-driven Logo with symbolic scripting to allow the kids to really get into the wonderful possibilities for strategies and tactics. (BTW, Etoys is kind of an OO event-driven Logo (not an accident), and the next version of it has as a goal to be able to do Robot Odyssey in a reasonable way. This got delayed because of funding problems but we now have funding and are really going to do it this year. Want to help design and build it?)

		<h3><a name="node137" href="http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/node/137">OLPC Visual Programming Language Discussion with Guido van Rossum and Alan Kay</a></h3>
		<blockquote>

		    <p>
			From: Alan Kay
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Guido knows that I've been advocating that the Python folks should do Etoys or a very Etoys like environment in Python (and that the rest of the OLPC be given an objectification and media and scripting integration that is Etoys like).
		    </p>
		    <p>
			However, there are simply zillions of things left to be done everywhere for OLPC so the first round of SW on the XO will be more of a gathering of "suggestive" features and abilities (of which Etoys is just one). That seems fine to me.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Viewpoints Research (our little non-profit) doesn't have any "ego or identity" staked around whether the children's authoring environment is Python based or Squeak based. I have said many times that, if the general integrative base of XO is to be Python, then the Etoys-like authoring should be based in Python also.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			However, I will personally fight to the death to make sure that there is a children's authoring environment that allows even young children to do simulation style programming with very rich media objects. 
		    </p>
		    <p>
			For now, that is Etoys. It could be a suitable object-oriented Logo with media objects (this is essentially what Etoys is). It could be some better design (let's do one). The base could be Javascript (if implemented on top of an integrated environment of sufficient power), Python (ditto), Ruby (ditto), etc. Whatever it is, it has to be above high thresholds, not a hack or a gesture.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Besides the programming the children use to learn important ideas in math and science, they also need to be able to see how their own computer world is structured by being able to "pop the hood" on practically everything they use. Perhaps it is OK for high school children to see the current code (but I don't think so). I think there needs to be a wrapping on the entire set of facilities that uses the same conventions that 9 year olds do their own programming in. Again, if it is to be Python, then it needs to be crafted a bit for younger children. E.g. Etoys allows easy unlimited parallel tasking, and this is very important for children's programming. Etc.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			There are many good things that can be done here. We live in a computing world in which there is a tremendous amount of identification between many programmers and the tools they use -- so strong that it resembles religious fervor. From my view, ALL of the system have such flaws that we are better off being critical of all of them and try to use the best ideas from everywhere.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			If "Children First!" is really the goal here, then we must spend most of our energies trying to make the childrens' environments more conducive to creative learning of powerful ideas.
		    </p>

		<blockquote>
		    <p>
			Hi Don --
		    </p>
		    <p>
			I'm writing to applaud you for your plans to reimplement SimCity for children on the OLPC.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			My main complaint about this game has always been the rigidity, and sometimes stupidity, of its assumptions (counter crime with more police stations) and the opaqueness of its mechanism (children can't find out what its actual assumptions are, see what they look like, or change them to try other systems dynamics).
		    </p>
		    <p>
			So I have used SimCity as an example of an anti-ed environment despite all the awards it has won. It's kind of an air-guitar environment.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			In the past, I tried to get Maxis to take the actual (great) educational possibilities more seriously, but to no avail.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Going to Python can help a few areas of this, but a better abstraction for the heart of Sim-City would be a way to show its rules/heuristics in a readable and writable form. Both of these could be stylized to put them in the child's own thinking and doing world. For example, just the simple route of making a drag and drop scripting interface for Etoys allows children to make very readable and writeable scripts and helps the children concentrate on what they are trying to do. A carefully designed object system (that is filtered fro children) can expose the environment so they can really think about it.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			I'm not at all suggesting that Etoys be used here, but I am suggesting that some deep design be done to come up with a "behavior modification interface" that allows real creativity on the part of the children. So it is much more than stringing black boxes together or having to deal with fragile procedurals.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			I sense that you have some interests in making SimCity really a microworld for children's learning and exploration from reading your webpage.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Children in 4th - 6th grade can do a lot here if they are given a good UI and tools. So, we could think of part of this project as a "pre-Python" UI.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Scalability and non-scalability of ideas are interesting. Rocky's Boots is still one of the best ever games that provide profound learning experiences. The extension of this to Robot Odyssey didn't work because the logic and wires programming didn't scale well enough -- the bang per effort dropped off precipitously. I was Chief Scientist at Atari at that time (Warren Robbinet worked for me) and I worked with TLC to try to get them to realize that something like Logo, or even better, a rule-based robot programming system, was needed. The failure of Robot Odyssey really pained me because I thought that the concept of this game was one of the best ever (still is). But it just needed a much better notion of how the children were going to program the robots. I think the same goes for SimCity.

		        It's hard to point to any programming language for beginners that has a really great form. One thing that has consistently worked is "close to natural language but clearly not natural language". That is, it really helps if the gist-view of a program is a kind of metaphor for what it does, even if one has to think harder about the detailed meaning. For children, Hypercard was OK in many respects for the gist-view, but was too like English for both deep understanding and for programming (many children had a hard time getting past the idea that Hypercard couldn't understand and do any reasonable English sentence). This was debated endlessly in Logo circles, and Logo wound up going from a much more English-like syntax to one much more like Lisp (this was a big mistake in my view). Finding the balance between these is critical, because it governs how much brain is left to the learner to think about content rather than form. And for most learners, it is the initial experiences that make the difference for whether they want to dive in or try to avoid future encounters.

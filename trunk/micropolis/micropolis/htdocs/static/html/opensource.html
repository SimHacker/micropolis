	<h1>Open Source Technology</h1>

	<p>
	    We are systematically building on the shoulders of giants,
	    by using a carefully chosen stack of proven, best of
	    breed, actively developed and supported, open source
	    software. 
	</p>

	<p>
	    We are purposefully developing modular, reusable open
	    source software components that other people can learn
	    from, and freely use for their own purposes.
	</p>

	<h2>Open Source Server Technology</h2>

	<ul>

	    <li>
	        <h3>This project uses the following open 
		source components:</h3>
	    </li>


	    <li>
		<a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>
		is a powerful, practical, efficient, Dutch-invented
		programming language, which is the standard language
		for the OLPC, a great first language to learn, and has
		a rich ecosystem of open source modules available.
	    </li>

	    <li>
		<a href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</a> 
		is a programming language integration tool, that makes
		it easy to interface the C++ SimCity code with Python
		and other languages.  The advantage to using SWIG is
		that it saves a vast amount of effort, and it makes it
		possible to integrate the same source code with other
		programming languages and runtime systems, like Java,
		Ruby or Lua as well as Python.
	    </li>

	    <li>
		<a href="http://www.turbogears.org">TurboGears</a> 
		is the web application server framework, which
		integrates SimCity with networking, database, xml,
		web page and graphics generation modules. The
		advantage of TurboGears is that it is small, modular,
		actively developed and supported, and well integrated
		with a powerful set of database and templating
		modules. (Including the following...)
	    </li>

	    <li>
		<a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org">SQLAlchemy</a>
		is the SQL Toolkit and Object Relational Mapper, that
		makes it easy and efficient to store and retrieve
		Python objects and any other kind of data in an SQL
		database. SQLAlchemy is capable of scaling up and
		taking advantage of advanced database features.
	    </li>

	    <li>
		<a href="http://genshi.edgewall.org">Genshi</a> 
		is a template system, which uses text and XML based
		macros for generating dynamic data driven HTML web
		pages, SVG graphics, and XML web services for AJAX
		clients. Genshi makes it easy to produce
		excruciatingly correct and clean web pages and XML
		protocols from dynamic data.
	    </li>

	    <li>
		<a href="http://www.cairographics.org">Cairo</a>
		is a high quality graphics library which is the
		standard graphics interface for the OLPC, and also
		useful on web servers for drawing dynamic images,
		maps, and visualizations.  It's cross platform,
		hardware accelerated, supports antialiased scalable
		PostScript-like graphics, outline fonts,
		internationalized text, and is very well suited for
		the needs of SimCity (zooming maps, overlays, graphs,
		data visualizations, printing). Cairo runs with
		hardware acceleration on Linux, Windows and Mac, and
		is used by the Mozilla Firefox web browser for
		rendering HTML web pages and SVG graphics.
	    </li>

	    <li>
	        <h3>This project has developed the following open 
		source components:</h3>
	    </li>

	    <li>
	        The 
		<a href="http://code.google.com/p/micropolis/source/browse/#svn/trunk/MicropolisCore/src/Micropolis">Micropolis Core Engine</a>
		is written in C++, and integrated into Python with
	        SWIG. The C++ code is based on the original SimCity C
	        code, but it has been cleaned up, re-organized and
	        optimized. It implements the authentic "SimCity
	        Algorithm", but it is a lot easier to understand and
	        maintain than the original code. All of the user
	        interface and graphics code has been stripped out, so
	        it can be implemented independently by the gui or web
	        server. Micropolis has a generic scripting language
	        independent callback mechanism, so the game can send
	        messages with parameters back to Python or Lua to
	        handle.  This enables scripting interesting scenarios
	        and extensions.
	    </li>

	    <li>
	        The 
		<a href="http://code.google.com/p/micropolis/source/browse/#svn/trunk/MicropolisCore/src/TileEngine">Tile Engine</a>
		uses Cairo to efficiently draw a scrolling zooming
	        grid of tiles: graphical symbols representing the
	        state of the map layer. It's independent of
	        Micropolis, and can be used to display any grid of
	        tiles for games, cellular automata, or scientific
	        visualizations.  It is implemented in C++, and calls
	        on the Cairo library to efficiently draw tiles with
	        hardware acceleration.  It supports seamless panning
	        and zooming like Google maps, and it can draw crisply
	        detailed tiles by calling back into the scripting
	        language to dynamically render scalable graphics
	        (i.e. SVG, PDF or Cairo drawings) into a cache.
	    </li>

	    <li>
	        The
		<a href="http://code.google.com/p/micropolis/source/browse/#svn/trunk/MicropolisCore/src/CellEngine">Cellular Automata Machine Engine</a>
		is another tile based mathematical simulation, about
		the intersection of artifical life, chaos and
		performance art. It's written in C++, and plugs into
		the Tile Engine, like Micropolis, but with a different
		set of tiles. It's a useful proving application, to
		make sure the Tile Engine is independent of Micropolis
		and useful for other purposes. It's also a fun way to
		teach mathematics and game theory, as well as the
		history of computing, since one of the historic rules
		it 
		<a href="http://code.google.com/p/micropolis/source/browse/trunk/MicropolisCore/src/CellEngine/cellengine.cpp#5209">implements</a>
		is John von Neumann's original
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_cellular_automaton">29 state universal construction cellular automata</a>.
	    </li>

	</ul>

	<p>
	    All of the above software is currently running on this web server,
	    but it is not yet a playable game.
	</p>

	<h2>Open Source Client Technology</h2>

	<p>
	    The Micropolis web server is independent of the
	    user interface, and it will support multiple ways of
	    viewing and manipulating the same model. It will be
	    possible to develop many advanced user interfaces,
	    visualizations and control techniques. But first we will
	    support the most practical delivery formats of our time:
	    DHTML and Flash.
	</p>

	<p>
	    From the starting gate, we want an easily accessible
	    DHTML/JavaScript "AJAX" user interface to SimCity, the
	    quality and usability of Google Maps: playable by a wide
	    audience, in standard browsers, on Linux, Mac, Windows,
	    from OLPC to iPhone.
	</p>

	<p>
	    We also want a high end "cinematic" Flash based user
	    interface, which will take advantage of Flash's advanced
	    multimedia capabilities, dynamic scalable graphics,
	    streaming video and real time events. It will deliver the
	    quality of experience that people take for granted from
	    YouTube and Flash web games, to Flash's 98% installed base.
	</p>

	<p>
	    Fortunately there is excellent open source software that
	    makes it possible to achieve both of those goals with one
	    open source software base.
	</p>

	<p>
	    <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org">OpenLaszlo</a>
	    is an open source user interface programming system, which
	    produces both Flash and HTML/JavaScript AJAX applications
	    from the same XML/JavaScript source code.  OpenLaszlo
	    makes it possible to create rich web based AJAX
	    applications that run in both Flash and ordinary web
	    browsers, using a proven stack of open source tools.
	</p>

	<p>
	    Don Hopkins will apply his previous experience with
	    SimCity gui design and OpenLaszlo development to this
	    project, to develop a web brower and Flash based user
	    interface for Micropolis Eduverse, while enabling other
	    web based interfaces to the same Micropolis Eduverse
	    server.

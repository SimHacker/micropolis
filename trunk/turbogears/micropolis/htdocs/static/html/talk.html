    <h1>Outside the Box: Micropolis Eduverse</h1>

    <h2>Vision</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Micropolis, the open source version of SimCity, is a fun, engaging
	game, that helps teach kids about science, economics, language,
	mathematics, art and politics.
      </li>
      <li>
	Its goal is to fulfill SimCity's potential as a microworld for
	children's learning and exploration.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is this running in the browser?</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Started with the originl Mac version of SimCity Classic. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Ported it to Unix, using the NeWS window system, writing the UI in PostScript. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Ported it to Unix, using the X11 window system, writing the UI in TCL/Tk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Designed and implemented colaborative multi player support. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Ported and adapted it to the OLPC, so EA could release it under GPLv3. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Stripped it down, removed the UI and scripting language, translated it to C++, cleaned it up and refactored it. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Integrated it with Python via SWIG. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Implemented C++ tile engine using the Cairo graphics library, and integrated it with Python via C++. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrote GTK based user interface in Python. Will support Sugar, but now runs on Windows/Mac/Linux.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrote a web server based application. Python/TurboGears/SQLAlchemy/Genshi/Cairo/Ming. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Implementing Flash based user interface to web server based application. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Using OpenLaszlo, to support both DHTML/JavaScript in ordinary web browsers, as well as Flash.
      </li>
      <li>
        Goal is to develop it into an educational multi player game, community sharing and blogging site, etc. 
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How can we apply Micropolis educationally?</h2>

    <blockquote>"There is no win or lose, just cause and effect." -Jeff Braun, Maxis</blockquote>

	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Write newspaper articles about things happening in the city. 
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Events in the game trigger opportunities to write newspaper stories. 
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Blogging dialog pops up, with tools for editing the story, including inserting illustrations.

	  <li>
	    Snapshots of the city, graphs, overlays, information visualizations, evaluations).
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Stories link to save file snapshots, and are published on the web sites as a newspaper or blug, so other players can browse and play them.

	    Voting on other players' proposals. 
	    <ul>
	      <li>
		A proposal can consist of a title, a description, some
		illustrations taken from the game or uploaded, bookmarks on the
		map, links to web sites related to the issue, an overlay of
		graphics and text drawn on the map, a budget requirement, some
		hypothetical map editing commands (build a zone, bulldoze and
		area, change the tax rate, etc), a message board for discussing
		the issue, a time limit until the election, and a voting interface
		for deciding the issue.  
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Once the issue is decided, the editing commands are applied (if
		possible), or the player who proposed it is given the authority to
		implement the proposal (given $1000 to use on building roads
		anywhere they decide, etc.)

		"The reasoning behind the idea is that it will result in improved
		road safety by forcing users to negotiate their way through shared
		areas at appropriate speeds and with due consideration for the
		other users of the space."
	      </li>
	      <li>
		A reason for the apparent paradox that reduced regulation leads to
		safer roads may be found by studying the risk compensation
		effect. Shared Space describe the effect:
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Shared Space is successful because the perception of risk may be a
		means or even a prerequisite for increasing objective
		safety. Because when a situation feels unsafe, people are more
		alert and there are fewer accidents.

	    Visual programming languages, like eToys, Robot Odyssey, SimAntics,

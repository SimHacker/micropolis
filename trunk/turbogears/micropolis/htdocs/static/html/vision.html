	<h2>Micropolis Eduverse Vision</h2>

	<p>
	    Micropolis, the open source version of SimCity, is a fun,
	    engaging game, that helps teach kids about science,
	    language, mathematics, art and politics. Its goal is to
	    fulfill SimCity's potential as a microworld for children's
	    learning and exploration.
	</p>

	<p>
	    A web based version of Micropolis is the best way to
	    quickly reach the largest audience, and an important step
	    towards the long term goal of developing an open source,
	    colaborative multi player, educationally oriented
	    simulation gaming platform.
	</p>

	<p>
	    This project is about creating educational open source
	    software. It's the culmination of years of research and
	    development, that is now possible thanks to Electronic
	    Arts making SimCity open source. 
	</p>

	<p>
	    Don Hopkins has worked with the SimCity source code
	    for 16 years, ported it to many platforms, redesigned the
	    user interface several times, designed and implemented
	    colaborative multi player support, cleaned up and
	    refactored the code, and integrated it with various
	    scripting languages,
	</p>

	</p>
	    He has written ambitious but realistic and successful proposals, 
	    petitioning Electronic Arts to
	    "<a href="http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/node/16">Develop Third Party Content Authoring Tools for The Sims</a>"
	    (which led to Transmogrifier and the thriving Sims player created content community),
	    and to develop
	    "<a href="http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/node/24">Educational Multi Player SimCity for Linux</a>"
	    (which led to EA releasing Open Source SimCity under GPLv3 for the OLPC, enabling the Micropolis project).
	</p>

	<p>
	    His long term dream of developing Micropolis into an
	    educational gaming platform draws heavily on the vision
	    and experience of educators, researchers and designers
	    including Seymore Papert, Hal Abelson, Alan Kay, Will
	    Wright, Ben Shneiderman, and Mark Weiser.
	</p>

	<p>
	    The Micropolis project is building an exemplary open
	    source game out of modular reusable components, that other
	    people can learn from, build on top of, integrate with
	    other languages and user interfaces, and use as a starting
	    point for their own projects.
	</p>

	<p>
	    The open source, component oriented approach to software
	    development will result in portable, cross platform,
	    educational software that can run on Linux, Mac, Windows,
	    embeded devices, OLPC XO-1 laptops, and other children's
	    computers.
	</p>

	<p>
	    These first steps will get us closer to realizing Alan
	    Kay's vision of using microworlds and scriptable agents
	    to teach kids science, mathematics and programming:

	       "I'm writing to applaud you for your plans to
	       reimplement SimCity for children on the OLPC." [...]
	   </p>
	   <p>
	       "I am suggesting that some deep design be done to come
	       up with a "behavior modification interface" that allows
	       real creativity on the part of the children." [...]
	   </p>
	   <p>
	       "I was Chief Scientist at Atari at that time (Warren
	       Robbinet worked for me) and I worked with TLC to try to
	       get them to realize that something like Logo, or even
	       better, a rule-based robot programming system, was
	       needed. The failure of Robot Odyssey really pained me
	       because I thought that the concept of this game was one
	       of the best ever (still is). But it just needed a much
	       better notion of how the children were going to program
	       the robots. I think the same goes for SimCity." [...]
	   </p>
	   <p>
	       "I sense that you have some interests in making SimCity
	       really a microworld for children's learning and
	       exploration from reading your

	    usually combine to make a game) in the service of the
	    children. We should really try to pull this off!"

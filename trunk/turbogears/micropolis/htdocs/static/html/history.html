	<h2>History of Micropolis (SimCity)</h2>

	<p>
	    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Wright_(game_designer)">Will Wright</a>
	    wrote the original
	    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simcity">SimCity</a>
	    city simulation game, first released in 1989.
	    On January 10, 2008 the SimCity source code was released under the free software 
	    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Version_3">GPL 3</a>
	    license under the name 
	    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropolis_(software)">Micropolis</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	    DUX Software licensed the rights from Maxis to port SimCity to
	    Unix in 1991.
	    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Hopkins">Don Hopkins</a>
	    started with the Mac version of the original SimCity Classic source code.
	    He ported it to various Unix platforms, 
	    re-designed the user interface, 
	    created a multi-player version,
	    and later adapted it for
	    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>
	    and the 
	    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olpc">OLPC</a>
	    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLPC_XO-1">XO-1 childrens' laptop</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	    He initially developed a version with PostScript graphics on the 
	    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS">NeWS window system</a>,
	    using the 
	    <a href="http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/hyperlook/index.html">HyperLook</a>
	    user interface development environment. 
	</p>

	<p>
	    He subsequently developed a multi player version of SimCity
	    for the X11 window system, using the 
	    <a href="">TCL/Tk</a>
	    scripting language and user interface toolkit.
	    It was
	    <a href="http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/simcity/simcity-announcement.html">shipped in 1993</a>
	    and
	    <a href="http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/simcity/simcity-review.html">reviewed in Unix-World</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	    The multi player "SimCityNet" user interface was demonstrated to
	    the HCI community in Amsterdam at the 
	    InterCHI'93 conference Interactive Experience, 
	    as described by the proposal,
	    "<a href="http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/simcity/simcitynet.html">SimCityNet: a Cooperative Multi User City Simulation</a>".
	</p>

	<p>
	    Electronic Arts/Maxis recently relicensed this lineage of
	    the SimCity Classic source code as Open Source software
	    under GPL3. Don Hopkins adapted it to the OLPC and brought
	    it up to EA's QA and branding requirements. Since it has
	    been released, he has continued to develop the code for
	    educational use.

Here are the things that need to be done before releasing a single
user version of the game, and how much effort I think they'll take
(Simple = 1, Difficult = 9).  We also need to allocate time for user
testing (to get feedback from people using it, and make changes based
on their input), and of course debugging and smoothing out rough
edges.

* keyboard commands: arrow, function keys (3)
  also need to disable autorepeat
* save/restore overlay (5)
  write all overlay information into another file, like Glasgow.city.overlay

* print city dialog (6)
  need to implement printing function and control panel from scratch
* help (8)
  must implement a help mechanism and put in lots of help
* manual (9)
  need to re-write manual, and do new illustrations
  must have a framemaker license to do this

We could probably come out with a solid beta release without printing,
help, or a manual.

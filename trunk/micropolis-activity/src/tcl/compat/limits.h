/*
 * limits.h --
 *
 *	This is a dummy header file to #include in Tcl when there
 *	is no limits.h in /usr/include.  The file is totally empty.
 *	In case you're wondering why Tcl includes the file at all
 *	if it can be empty, it's because there's already code in
 *	tclUnix.h to #define anything that's not defined in limits.h.

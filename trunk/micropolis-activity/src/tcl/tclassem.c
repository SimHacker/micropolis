 * Tcl_AssembleCmd --
 *
 *	This is a utility procedure to assist in situations where
 *	commands may be read piece-meal from some input source.  Given
 *	some input text, it adds the text to an input buffer and returns
 *	whole commands when they are ready.
 *
 * Results:
 *	If the addition of string to any currently-buffered information
 *	results in one or more complete Tcl commands, then the return value
 *	is a pointer to the complete command(s).  The command value will
 *	only be valid until the next call to this procedure with the
 *	same buffer.  If the addition of string leaves an incomplete
 *	command at the end of the buffer, then NULL is returned.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	If string leaves a command incomplete, the partial command
 *	information is buffered for use in later calls to this procedure.
 *	Once a command has been returned, that command is deleted from
 *	the buffer on the next call to this procedure.

 *	mouse- and button-related events among collections of
 *	windows.  It is used primarily for menus.  For example,
 *	if one menu is posted and mouse moves over the menu button
 *	for a different menu, then the menubutton needs to see the
 *	event so that it can post itself and unpost the first menu.

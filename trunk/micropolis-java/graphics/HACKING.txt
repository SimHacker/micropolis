The Recipe File
===============

The `tiles.rc' file is the recipe file for generating the tiles.
It is a plain-text file, where each line begins with a tile id,
followed by an image specification.

The image specification consists of one or more image layers separated
by the pipe character (|). The layers are drawn in the order specified.

A layer is a file name (excluding the .png extension), optionally followed
by @X,Y, where X,Y specify the upper-left corner of the rectangle to
draw.


==============================
Generating the composite image
==============================

To build a new tiles.png file, do the following:

1. Open a command-prompt, and cd to the micropolis-java directory.

2. Build Micropolis by typing the following command:

    ant

3. The generated tiles.png file can be found in the build/ subdirectory.

4. Now you can run Micropolis with the new graphics. Type:

    java -jar micropolisj.jar

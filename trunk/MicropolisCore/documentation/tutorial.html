<h1>Tutorial -- A Walk Through Your City</h1>

<h2>Starting Up</h2>

To start up Micropolis, go to the Micropolis directory and run the shell
script named "Micropolis". The computer will chug for a while as
HyperLook and Micropolis are loaded. You'll know things are going well
when you see the Introduction Screen.  <p>

<i>The Introduction Screen</i><p>

Once Micropolis is loaded, the Introduction Screen will go away and be
replaced by a Welcome Notice, and a Startup Window with a bunch of
buttons for cities and scenarios.  <p>

<i>The Welcome Notice</i><p>

<i>The Startup Window</i><p>

In case you wonder about any of the buttons or graphics, you can get
help on anything by pointing at it and pressing the "Help" key. So try
pressing "Help" over the weird little grill in the upper right corner
of the Startup Window. This brings up the HyperLook Help stack. Click
on "Done" to dismiss it.  <p>

<i>The Help Stack</i><p>

<h2>Generating a New City</h2>

Now click the left mouse button on the "New City" button. The Welcome
Notice will turn into a control panel for setting up a New City, and
the Startup Screen will turn into a Terrain Generator with a map and
some buttons.  <p>

<i>The New City Panel</i><p>

<i>The Terrain Generator</i><p>

<h2>City Name</h2>

You can set the name of your city by clicking the left button on the
"City Name" text field, and typing the name. The delete key erases the
last character, and Control-U erases to the beginning of the line. You
can double or triple click on the name to select it, and it will be
deleted when you type a new name.  <p>

<h2>Game Level</h2>

The three exclusive settings let you select the Game Level. Choose
"Easy" for now, by clicking the left mouse button. If you're just
starting out, you can certainly use the extra money!  <p>

<h2>Generate New Terrain</h2>

If you're not satisfied with the terrain map you see, just press
"Generate New Terrain", and you will get a new map. You can do this as
many times as you like, until you get a nice map.  <p>

<i>Randomly Generated Terrain Maps</i><p>

<h2>Use This Map</h2>

When you are happy with the terrain map, press the "Use This Map"
button, and the game will begin!  <p>

<h2>The Edit Window</h2>

You're now playing Micropolis! The Edit Window, which is the main window
used for controlling Micropolis, will be displayed: <p>

<i>The Edit Window</i><p>

The Edit Window is where you will do the actual building and zoning.
In the middle of the Edit Window is a detailed map showing part of the
terrain. Around the edges are controls and fields displaying
information about the city.  <p>

Along the top edge of the window is the City Name, where the name of
your city or the scenario you selected is displayed. Clicking on it
brings the window to the front.  <p>

In the upper left corner is a picture of the City Simulator.
If you click on that, the Introduction Screen will be displayed
to show the credits, version, and copyrights. Click on the
Introduction Screen to dismiss it.  <p>

On the left edge, below the City Simulator, is a Close Box. Clicking
the left button on the Close Box closes the Edit Window into a small
icon, a miniature version of the window. Thanks to the way HyperLook
is designed, when a window is iconified, it continues to animate. You
can double click on an icon to open it back up to a full sized window.
<p>

There is a row of Menu Buttons below the title, to the right of the
Close Box. Pressing the right mouse button down over any of these
buttons pops up a menu, from which you can select using the right
mouse button. Clicking the left mouse button over a Menu Button
selects the menu's default item, without displaying the menu. The
default menu item has a black ring or rectangle around it. You can set
the default by pressing the Control key when the menu is up.  <p>

There are three fields below the Menu Buttons, that display your
Current Funds (in dollars), the Current Date (the year and month), and
important Messages (one at a time). Clicking on them just brings the
window to the front.  <p>

Along the left edge of the window are two columns of colorful Tool
Icons, used for choosing the city editing mode. Click the mouse over
an icon to select an editing tool. The currently selected tool is
highlighted in yellow. The Tool Cost field along the bottom edge of
the window tells you the name of the selected tool, and how many
dollars it costs to use.  <p>

You can use the selected tool by pressing the left mouse button over
the map in the middle of the Edit Window. Also, you can pop up a Pie
Menu to quickly switch between editing tools, by clicking the right
mouse button over the map. You can easily scroll the map by pressing
the middle mouse button down over the map and dragging the view
around.  <p>

The Demand Indicator shows the demand levels for Residential (green),
Commercial (blue), and Industrial zones (yellow), and can be helpful
in planning your city.  <p>

The Zoom Control changes the magnification of the map. You can zoom in
or out to make the graphics larger or smaller, or press the Zoom Reset
button to zoom back to normal. The animation is fastest at the normal
size.  <p>

All of the Micropolis windows have Drag Edges with which you can move the
window around, and Resize Corners to change the size of the window.
Some windows cannot be resized, so the resize corners just move them
around. To use them, press the left mouse button down over the corner
or edge, and move the outline to where you want it. The window will
move or resize to that location, when you release the button.  <p>

The main portion of the map is land. Your available land is made up of
three types of terrain. The brown areas are Clear Land, the green
areas are forests and Trees, and the blue areas are Water. You can
build only on Clear Land. You can clear forest and extend coastlines
with your bulldozer. You can run roads, rails, and power lines
straight across the Water.  <p>

<h2>The Map Window</h2>

The other window that's shown when you start the game is the Map
Window, which displays an overview of your entire city map: <p>

<i>The Map Window</i><p>

You can see different demographic views of the city, chosen by the
icons on the left. The type of map is shown along the top edge of the
window, to the right of the Close Box.  <p>

There is a yellow rectangle in the Map Window that shows the location
of the detailed city view. (There may be more than one yellow
rectangles, if multiple views are visible.) Press the mouse button
down over the yellow rectangle, and drag it around the map, to scroll
the view.  <p>

<h2>Building a City</h2>

To begin a city, we need: places for Sims to live, places for Sims to
work, and power.  <p>

You can only build on Clear Land, so use the Bulldozer to clear away
some trees. Click the left mouse button on the Bulldozer Icon. Move
the cursor over to land. It now points to a small square, outlining
the area that will be bulldozed when you click the left button. The
Trees under your pointer are now Clear Land. Now, hold the left button
down and drag the pointer across the Trees. Mass destruction. Clear a
large area of land to prepare for building.  <p>

Click the Residential Icon, then move back to your terrain. Your
cursor will now point to a large square outline. This outline
indicates how much clear space you will need to create a Residential
Zone -- a place for Sims to live. Clicking the left mouse button in
Clear Land will "zone" that area. The "R" in the zone center indicates
that it is a Residential Zone. The flashing lightning symbol means
that the zone has no power. Place a few more Residential Zones next to
the first one.  <p>

<i>Several New Residential Zones</i><p>

Now decide where to position a Power Plant in your city. Point to the
Power Plant Icon, and press and hold the left mouse button. A menu
will appear, giving you the option of choosing a Coal or Nuclear
plant. For now, release the button over "Coal". The outline for a
Power Plant is even larger than for a Residential Zone. Place the
Power Plant in some open space near your Residential Zones. If your
Power Plant is not directly adjacent to a Residential Zone, you'll
need to run a Power Line from your Power Plant to the Residential
Zones.  <p>

To do this, click the left mouse button over the Power Line Icon. By
pointing your cursor and pressing the button, lay Power Lines from
your Power Plant to your Residential Zones. Adjacent Power Line
sections will automatically connect to each other. Road and Rail lines
connect in the same manner.  <p>

In a moment, the flashing symbols in the Residential Zones will
disappear, indicating that your zones have been powered. Any zones
that are adjacent to a powered zone do not need separate Power Lines
run to them. Soon you will see small houses start to appear. The Sims
have started to move in!  <p>

<i>Here Comes the Neighborhood!</i><p>

Once there are a few Residential Zones, where Sims can live, you need
to make it possible for your new residents to find jobs. They can't
all work at the power plant!  <p>

<i>Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Zones</i><p>

Now you're ready for Commercial and Industrial areas; places for Sims
to work, shop, and transact business. Select the Commercial Icon and
place a few Commercial Zones near your Residential ones. Then select
the Industrial Icon and place some Industrial Zones. Connect all
necessary Power Lines.  <p>

Notice that as you select different Tool Icons, the icon's description
and its associated cost will be displayed in the Tool Cost field near
the lower left corner of the Edit Window. The Current Funds field near
the top of the window displays your total funds available.  <p>

Now click the left button on the Road Icon and add Roads from your
Residential housing to the Commercial and Industrial areas to allow
the Sims to commute to work. Road sections connect themselves like
Power Line sections. Once you have Roads, traffic will be generated.
<p>

<i>Roads with Traffic</i><p>

Now move the cursor to the Menu Button labelled "Windows", and press
the right mouse button down. The Windows Menu will pop up below the
cursor. Drag the cursor to the menu item labelled "Budget", and
release the right button. This brings up the Budget Window, which lets
you set the level of funding for your fire, police, and transportation
departments.  <p>

<i>The Budget Window</i> <p>

Click the left mouse button on the up and down arrows, or drag the
sliders to change the funding levels. You can also adjust the current
tax rate. If you have no police or fire departments, you can't fund
them. You cannot fund more than 100%. Since your city is so new, you
can't do much here now, but come back later. Click the left mouse
button on the "Go With These Figures" button to make the window go
away when you're done. If the hour glass runs out, the window will go
away automatically. You can click on the hourglass to keep that from
happening.  <p>

Now look at the Map Window. You can get an idea of the size of your
city, and how much room you have left. Try the different map views by
clicking the left mouse button on the icons along the left edge of the
Map Window. You will need this information to build and adjust
conditions in your city. For example, you can pinpoint the areas with
the highest crime to determine locations for new police stations.  <p>

<i>The Map Window</i><p>

Additional information can be gained through the available Graphs.
Unlike the Maps, which only show the current state of your city, the
Graphs give you a record of the past so you can gauge trends and
cycles. You can display the Graph Window by selecting the item
labelled "Graph" from the Window Menu.  <p>

<i>The Graph Window</i><p>

You can toggle the various graph displays on and off, and switch
between 10 year and 120 year graphs, by clicking on the icons at the
left of the Graph Window.  <p>

Another way to gather information about your city is by using the
Query Tool. To use this, select the Tool Icon with the magnifying
glass and question mark, or hold down the "Q" key, then press the left
mouse button over the map in the Edit Window. You will be shown a
window filled with information about the zone under the cursor.  <p>

<i>The Zone Status Window</i> <p>

Now, let's Save the city to disk. Use the File Menu to select "Save
City as...". You'll see the Save File dialog. Near the top of the
window is a text field labelled "File:". You can select a directory by
typing its name into the text field, or by double clicking in the
scrolling list. Then you can type in a name for your city, ending with
the ".city" extension, and press return. Your city will be saved to
disk, so you can load it later to get back to where you are now.  <p>

<i>Save File Dialog</i> <p>

To load a city, use the File Menu and select the item labelled "Load
City...". The Open File dialog looks and works almost like the Save
File dialog. It will start out in a directory named "Cities", which
contains some interesting cities included with Micropolis. You can load
and play any of them, or navigate to the directory where you saved
your city, and load that again.  <p>

<i>Open File Dialog</i> <p>

This is all the basic information you need to run Micropolis, but we
suggest reading on. The User Reference section explains in detail how
to use each program function. Inside Micropolis explains the inner
workings of the simulator, and gives some brief hints and tips for
using it. There is also an essay on The History of Cities and City
Planning, and a Bibliography for serious City Planners.  <p>

Have Fun Playing Micropolis!  <p>

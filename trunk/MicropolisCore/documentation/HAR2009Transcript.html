    <p>
      I'm Don Hopkins, and this is the 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropolis_(software)" target="_new">Micropolis</a>
       Online project.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll give you a quick history, and then try to get through the slides
      to the demo.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started working on 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity" target="_new">SimCity</a>
      about 1992.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I saw it at 
      <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/" target="_new">college</a>
      before that, I just fell in love with it, and really wanted to
      figure out how it worked, and do stuff with the user
      interface and everything.
    </p>

    <p>
      So when I had the chance to port 
      <a href="http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/hyperlook/SimCity.README" target="_new">SimCity to the Sun Workstation</a>,
      I jumped at that, and made a version of it using the 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS">NeWS</a>
      window system,
      James Gosling's
      PostScript based window system.
    </p>

    <p>
      And then I developed an 
      <a href="http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/simcity/simcity-announcement.html" target="_new">X11 version of SimCity</a>,
      which was multi player. We sold that as a
      Unix product. Then the contract expired on that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Later on I went on to 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxis" target="_new">Maxis</a>
      to work on 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims" target="_new">The Sims</a>
      with
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Wright_(game_designer)" target="_new">Will Wright</a>.
    </p>

    <a
      href="images/Will_Wright.jpg"
    ><img
        style="float: right; padding-left: 10px;"
        src="images/Will_Wright_Thumb.jpg"
        width="200"
        height="168"
    /></a>

    <p>
      I dredged up this SimCity code, and we talked Electronic Arts into
      making it open source under the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gpl_v3#Version_3" target="_new">GPLv3</a>
      a few years ago.
    </p>

    <p>
      The argument -- not the argument: actually they were very pleasant
      about it -- the thing that convinced them that it was a good idea was
      the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olpc" target="_new">One Laptop Per Child</a>
      project.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the OLPC project is focused on 
      "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructionist_learning" target="_new">Constructionist Education</a>",
      which is about children learning -- anyone learning, by building
      things.
    </p>

    <p>
      And SimCity is pretty much the 
      <a href="http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/node/129" target="_new">quintessential constructionist education game</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      But it need to be
      <a href="http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/node/145" target="_new">opened up</a>,
      so that it can be even better.
    </p>

    <img
      style="float: right; padding-left: 10px;"
      src="images/Seymour_Papert.jpg"
      width="170"
      height=" 198"
    />

    <p>
      This OLPC project is based on 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert" target="_new">Seymour Papert's</a>
      ideas about 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_programming_language" target="_new">teaching children to program</a>,
      even when they're very young, and 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay" target="_new">Alan Kay's</a>
      ideas about the 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynabook" target="_new">Dynabook</a>
      and
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" target="_new">object oriented programming</a>,
      and
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_learning" target="_new">how kids learn</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      And one of the important things about constructionism is kids helping
      each other, communicating and teaching each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      I took the old X11 version, and I had made it multi player for
      X-Windows, but I simplified it and took that out for this. 
      Now that
      <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpKhh10K-j0" target="_new">runs on the OLPC</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      What we really needed to do was to make a new version that had a much
      better user interface designed to take advantage of the things the
      OLPC can do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately, the OLPC project chose to use
      <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Python" target="_new">Python</a>
      as the official scripting language. Python is a
      <a href="http://www.livewires.org.uk/python/home" target="_new">powerful, easy to learn language</a>,
      that is
      <a href="http://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/edu-sig/" target="_new">widely used in education</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But let me go on:
    </p>

    <h2>
      Micropolis Project Goals
    </h2>

    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Develop a fun web based educational game, based on the original
          SimCity source code.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Focused on constructionist education.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built out of free open source software.
            </li>
            <li>
              Runs on the server, plays in the browser.
            </li>
            <li>
              Supports collaborative, democratic, multi-user play.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </h3>

    /></a>

    <p>
      The goals: We want to make a fun game that's based on the original
      source code.
    </p>

    <p>
      And "Constructionist Education" is a the overall theme, but it's very
      hard to figure out how that actually manifests itself in a game.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're using free open source software, distributing it over the
      web, and running it on centralized servers.
    </p>

    <p>
      We want to put in features to support collaboration, voting,
      teach democracy, and also teach language skills and
      interpersonal communication skills.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Accomplishments So Far

    <p>
      So far what I've done: First, we took the old
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">TCL/Tk/X11</a>
      version, cleaned it up, got it through EA's Quality Assurance,
      and put it on the One Laptop Per Child.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then we stripped down the code, translated it into C++, then
      cleaned it up, refactored it, and took out all the user
      interface. Then we started building a new user interface on top
      of that.
    </p>

    <p>
      I had some really great help from some talented people. 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilmore_(activist)" target="_new">John Gilmore</a>
      supported me for many years during the development of SimCity,
      and shepherded it through the complex legal process of
      relicensing it under GPLv3.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://yp.wtb.tue.nl/se/showemp_t3.php/873" target="_new">Albert Hofkamp</a>
      is a software developer at the Eindhoven University of
      Technology. He helped me clean up this code, and put Doxygen
      documentation into it. Now the code is much sturdier and easier
      to do something with.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://portfoliovantom.blogspot.com/" target="_new">Tom Tjon A Loi</a>
      is a an artist who's also helping on the project. I'll
      show you some ideas that we've put together about what direction it's
      going to go in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      And also we're benefiting from 
      <a href="http://www.kennisnet.nl" target="_new">Kennisnet</a>
      and
      <a href="http://www.ibm.com/nl/nl/" target="_new">IBM Netherlands</a>,
      who are helping us make an educational version of this game.
    </p>

    <p>
      The OLPC has been something for people to focus on, and get a
      bunch of people on board to make this happen. But we want
      Micropolis to run on as many different platforms as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      What's really wonderful is that I have had some really great
      conversations about this and encouragement from Alan Kay, who has been
      trying to do this stuff for years with kids.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/node/134" target="_new">Alan Kay's criticism of SimCity</a>
      is that you can't see inside of it and understand what it's
      doing, and you have to accept it as a black box. So now I'm
      trying to solve that problems.

      Open Source Software
    </h2>

    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Micropolis is built with a carefully chosen, well proven, widely
          supported set of open source ,cross platform tools and libraries.
        </li>
        <li>
          Micropolis itself and its TileEngine module are open source
          (GPL3). The client runs on the proprietary Adobe Flash
          player. The client will also run in standard browsers with a
          little more work, thanks to OpenLaszlo.

    <p>
      We're using a whole bunch of
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_open_source_software" target="_new">Free and open source software</a>,
      building on top of it, and then making new software that's open
      source.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the things that the OLPC project wants 
      <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Game_development" target="_new">game developers</a>
      to do is to make games out of modular components that can be
      plugged together to make other games.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I've been separating out the
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/micropolis/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FMicropolisCore%2Fsrc%2FCellEngine%2Fsrc" target="_new">tile engine</a>
      of SimCity, and the sprites, and the sound, and trying to make
      those work for other things.

        width="200"
        height="170"
    /></a>

    <p>
      The architecture of the web version is that there's a C++ game. And
      I'm using
      <a href="http://www.swig.org" target="_new">SWIG</a>,
      a tool for making wrappers for libraries, and plugging
      them into extension language. And it lets you get your library to a
      whole bunch of different extension languages. So right now it's
      Python, but it could be Lua or Java or whatever.
    </p>

    <p>
      There's another layer, which is gluing the game into Python. And the
      nice thing about SWIG, is that you can subclass your C++ classes in
      Python, and then just script everything in a nice language. 
    </p>

    <p>
      It's all open source stuff. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The web server does HTTP and it does 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Message_Format" target="_new">Adobe AMF</a>,
      which is kind of like binary JSON for Flash.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now I'm doing the client in another open source scripting language called 
      <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org" target="_new">OpenLaszlo</a>. 
      It's like JavaScript and XML that gets compiled into Flash. 
      But it will also compile into generic DHTML. 
    </p>

    <a
      href="images/Micropolis_GTK.png"
    ><img
        style="float: right; padding-left: 10px;"
        src="images/Micropolis_GTK_Thumb.png"
        width="200"
        height="156"
    /></a>

    <p>
      Right now I'm concentrating on just getting the Flash interface
      working, and once the paint's dry on that, I can then do the parts
      that were Flash specific using the Canvas and DHTML and things.
    </p>

    <p>
      The intention is to get it independent of Flash, but Flash is the
      fastest way to get it working first.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other thing I have is a Python scripted GTK based user
      interface, for the desktop.

      Internationalization
    </h2>

    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All text comes from Unicode XML localization files, so the 
          text can be translated to support different languages and 
          countries.
        </li>
        <li>
          Currently supports English and Dutch, but other languages are
          easy to add, given translation resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          Web based tools for conveniently reviewing and editing
          translations.
        </li>
        <li>
          This is a very important feature, since we're initially
          delivering to the Dutch educational system, and we intend
          to support many other languages in the future.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </h3>

    <p>
      Another important thing is internationalizing it and taking all the
      strings out. I would love to have volunteers to help translate it to
      other languages. I made a little web based tool to do that. We're
      doing this for the Dutch educational system, with Kennisnet's support.

    <p>
      Previously I made a 
      <a href="http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/simcity/simcitynet.html" target="_new">multi player version of this for X11</a>.
      But X11 doesn't scale very well, and it was kind of an experiment. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But it did test out some ideas of making it a collaborative,
      cooperative game, instead of a competitive game.
    </p>

    <p>
      I didn't want to mess up the game, but I wanted to layer another
      social game on top of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're all sharing the same money, we're trying to achieve the same
      goals, so if somebody does something that pisses you off, you're going
      to be mad at them, and won't play with them. That will play out at a
      higher level than the game.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's got voting for expensive things, like making a nuclear power
      plant, or changing the taxes. And the non-expensive things are just a
      free-for-all.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want to re-visit the multi player game, but first get a really solid
      base to build it on top of. So doing a web based game is the best way
      to do that.

    <h2>
      Constructionist Education
    </h2>

    <h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The original SimCity game was an exemplary constructionist
          educational game, which has been successfully used in many
          classrooms, but it was a closed commercial product, not
          specifically designed to support education.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since Micropolis is open source SimCity, we can open up,
          renovate, visualize, document and extend it in wonderful ways,
          to specifically support constructionist education, social
          networking and collaborative democratic play.
        </li>
        <li>
          "One of the most wonderful possibilities about this venture is
          that it will bring together very fluent designers from many 
          worlds of computing (more worlds than usually combine to make a 
          game) in the service of the children. We should really try to 
          pull this off!" -Alan Kay

    <img
      style="float:right; padding-left: 10px;"

      width="200"
      height="173"
    />

    <p>
      I'm adding stuff, like integrating it with 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediawiki" target="_new">MediaWiki</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the important things about Constructionist Education is getting
      people to help each other out, and chat.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want to teach language skills with this. Not just how to be a good
      mayor. That's not the goal. It's how to write about what you want to
      do, and convince other people to vote for it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think it's going to be nice to embed this in things like 
      <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/micropolisonline" target="_new">Facebook</a>
      and
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediawiki" target="_new">MediaWiki</a>,
      because what you're doing is writing stories and
      newspapers, and blogging.
    </p>

    <a
      href="images/The_Sims_Box.jpg"
    ><img
        style="float:right; padding-left: 10px; clear: both;"
        src="images/The_Sims_Box_Thumb.jpg"
        width="183"
        height="200"
    /></a>

    <p>
      The Sims 1 (and later versions) had something called 
      <a href="http://www.thesims3.com/exchange" target="_new">The Sims Exchange</a>,
      where when you save your game file, it also writes out a bunch
      of web files, that describe your house, your family, the story
      you've told about them with pictures. And then it uploads that
      to the web.
    </p>

    <p>
      So really, playing the game is a web publishing tool. I want to apply
      those ideas to SimCity, and that would be in the form of a
      newspaper. So you could act as a journalist when something
      happened. 
    </p>

    <p>
      These events in the game are generating opportunities for you to click
      on it, open it up, and write about what your interpretation of it
      is. And then automatically push it into a wiki page or a blog.
    </p>

    <p>
      So the result of playing a game will be this rich save file that has
      points of interest with stories attached to them. You could look at it
      geographically as a map, to see all the points of interest. You could
      look at it as a calendar, like a blog. And then all these things that
      happened with the story can link to a save file, so you can then jump
      back into the game at that point.
    </p>

    <a
      href="images/Don_Hopkins_Handwaving.jpg"

        style="float:right; padding-left: 10px; clear: both;"
        src="images/Don_Hopkins_Handwaving_Thumb.jpg"
        width="200"
        height="121"
    /></a>

    <p>
      I want to make sort of like TiVo for SimCity, is the eventual
      goal. You have all these save file snapshots, and then you can fast
      forward and reverse by replaying the edits that you did.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can imagine that when you play game, at any point, if you decide
      "let's raise taxes", you could make a checkpoint there. And then you
      could revisit that decision, and then branch reality out to another
      thing, if you didn't raise taxes.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want players to be able to make a tree of possibilities, and then
      share all these save files, and then comment on them, and write about
      them.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's where the educational stuff comes in. The teacher should be
      able to write scenarios that plug into the game, that generate events,
      and give people things to discuss.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alan Kay said some really wonderful things about the project to
      bring open source SimCity to the OLPC:
    </p>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        "One of the most wonderful possibilities about this venture is that
        it will bring together very fluent designers from many worlds of
        computing (more worlds than usually combine to make a game) in the

        -<a href="http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/node/145" target="_new">Alan Kay</a>
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm looking for volunteers. I never thought I'd be working directly or
      indirectly with Alan Kay, so it just blew my mind that he was
      interested in it. And he's very supportive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's the long term goal: There's a game, and there's a robot or a
      monster. You double click on a monster, and it should open up a window
      that has a visual program that controls how it behaves.
    </p>

    <p>
      This has already been done in the 80's on the Apple ][, and it was a
      game called 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Odyssey" target="_new">Robot Odyssey</a>,
      by
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Robinett" target="_new">Warren Robinett</a>,
      who made
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_(Atari_2600)" target="_new">Atari Adventure</a>. 
      And it was so before its time. It turns out that it is one of
      <a href="http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/node/139" target="_new">Alan Kay's favorite games</a>,
      and that he's 
      <a href="http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/node/145" target="_new">waiting for the other shoe to drop</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Robot Odyssey taught
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language" target="_new">visual programming</a>
      and logic to kids. You go inside a robot, and it's a room, with
      plugs and sensors, and you have logic parts that you can bring
      out, and make a circuit inside that robot.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I'm trying to do -- oh I'd better get to the demo -- is do this
      within SimCity. And with a visual programming language that's just a
      layer on top of 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" target="_new">Python</a>.
      We already have Python. I like Python. It's well designed. I'm
      not going to try to invent something different, I just want to
      give you a visual way to get to anything.

    <p>
      Creative writing, blogging, twittering and chatting: and all this
      social stuff that people do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Democracy. Writing proposals. Trying to get somebody to support your
      proposal. Publishing things into wikis. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Opening it up to enable plugin programming. The first step is to look
      at the code to see how it works. And then tweak it and change it, and
      then make your whole new thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      The older kids I want to teach Python and C++ programming.
    </p>

    <p>
      And then younger kids will have this easier, higher level language to
      do logic.

      application.
    </p>

    <p>
      Slow the game down a lot, so on your Facebook page it will let your

    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediawiki" target="_new">MediaWiki</a>

      In a multiplayer game, there could be several people in the same game,

      game, with collaborative editing.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you put something down, it would put an interface that says: "Hey,
      somebody wants to make this. Do you vote for it? Yes or no." And then
      have a chat associated with that.

      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/micropolis/source/browse/trunk/MicropolisCore/src/pyMicropolis/micropolisEngine/micropolisrobot.py" target="_new"show some code</a>.
      This is how PacMan works. He follows the road.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I wrote a plugin robot that you can put into the thing. 
    </p>

        width="540"
        height="405"
    />
    <br/>

    <p>
      I'd better get to the actual code that's running. 
    </p>

    <img
        src="images/Micropolis_Demo_01.jpg"
        width="540"
        height="405"
    />
    <br/>

    <p>
      These are the different scenarios, we could load, or generate
      something randomly. Here, we'll do one of my favorite cities here. I
      made this city.
    </p>

    <img
        src="images/Micropolis_Demo_02.jpg"
        width="540"
        height="405"
    />
    <br/>

    <p>
      This is a neat kind of a
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/micropolis/source/browse/trunk/MicropolisCore/src/TileEngine/src/tileengine.cpp" target="_new">lazy tile view</a>.
      There are 120 by 100 tiles on the server, and we're telling the
      server where we're looking at. And it's sending just the tiles
      that we need to see.
    </p>

    <img
        src="images/Micropolis_Demo_03.jpg"
        width="540"
        height="405"
    />
    <br/>

    <p>
      Things that happen in the city get logged, and there's a chat. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This will help you figure out what you need to do to improve you
      city. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a history. 
    </p>

    <img
        src="images/Micropolis_Demo_04.jpg"
        width="540"
        height="405"
    />
    <br/>

    <p>
      Here's the nice one here: we can raise taxes a lot. It was so funny
      because the taxes in the Netherlands are so much more than 20%. 
    </p>

    <img
        src="images/Micropolis_Demo_05.jpg"
        width="540"
        height="405"
    />
    <br/>

    <p>
      We can look at the population density map overlay.
    </p>

    <img
        src="images/Micropolis_Demo_06.jpg"
        width="540"
        height="405"
    />
    <br/>

    <p>
      Ok, now here's a meltdown. And when you get a meltdown, the notice
      window says "Hey there's a meltdown!", and has a live view showing it,
      that you can click on to go there.
    </p>

    <img
        src="images/Micropolis_Demo_07.jpg"
        width="540"
        height="405"
    />
    <br/>

    <p>
      Now this little window up here, when something interesting happens in
      the game, will show you a live view, and tell you something. But we
      can also have a link to Wikipedia or whatever.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want to put in more educational stuff. Like the church says "Hey,
      did you know that Scientologists believe this?" and "Click here for
      more!". We can think of the churches as in-game advertising.
    </p>

    <p>
      And then if you have too many churches, you use the bulldozer to get
      rid of the.
    </p>

    <p>
      There's a speed control. I can make it go super-duper fast. And
      everybody just left. This is more like a twitch game.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let me do the cheat. Ok, what is it? I just added this, so I'm not
      quite sure. You go "!faith 1000". That makes them want a lot more
      churches. Woah! Ok, so I'm getting churches. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I've only done one church, besides the generic one. So they just have
      little numbers. And I'm going to have a "Tax the Churches" option,
      too. Those are weird generic churches. If I lower the taxes, then more
      people will come in, and the churches will recruit them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Oh, I ran out of money. Let me do the robots real quick. So this is
      PacMan. You can put him down. Oh, I'm out of money! The fastest way is
      to just refresh the screen, and start fresh. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We'll go straight in, we'll get rid of this. Oh, pie menus, right!  If
      you click... (Dutch "Taartmenu" cursor pops up!) I've got to have a
      talk with my translator.
    </p>

    <img
        src="images/Micropolis_Demo_08.jpg"
        width="540"
        height="405"
    />
    <br/>

    <p>
      You click, and you get a pie menu, which has items around the cursor
      in different directions. So if you click and go right, you get a road.
      And then you can do a little road. And if you click and go up and
      right, you get a bulldozer.
    </p>

    <img
        src="images/Micropolis_Demo_09.jpg"
        width="540"
        height="405"
    />
    <br/>

    <p>
      And then there are submenus for zoning parks, and stuff like
      that. This gives you a nice quick gesture interface.
    </p>

    <img
        src="images/Micropolis_Demo_10.jpg"
        width="540"
        height="405"
    />
    <br/>

    <p>
      The one I wanted was PacBot. So if you click him, that's running
      Python code that is looking at the map, and is looks for the traffic,
      and it goes up, up, up, up, up. See? 
    </p>

    <img
        src="images/Micropolis_Demo_11.jpg"
        width="540"
        height="405"
    />
    <br/>

    <p>
      Wait, you haven't -- hang on, wait: you can have lots of them. And
      then they compete. You get this wonderful emergent behavior of PacMan
      looking for traffic, and then the other PacMan eats it. You really
      need to zoom this up a little bit.
    </p>

    <img
        src="images/Micropolis_Demo_12.jpg"
        width="540"
        height="405"
    />
    <br/>

    <p>
      The great thing about this: this is another game layered on top. You
      can make your PacMan maze, and then you can torture them. They'll go
      crazy, it's like a lion in his cage here. Ah, caught one! Ah! He's
      blue. Let's get him here. He's not going to be happy about
      this. Where'd he go? Oh oh, there's a menu to get rid of him, so I
      think I deleted him. Here, we'll put one there. He's just going nuts
      there. 
    </p>

    <img
        src="images/Micropolis_Demo_13.jpg"
        width="540"
        height="405"
    />
    <br/>

    <p>
      Wait, where were we? Real quick. Where's my iPhone? Did I leave the
      phone down here? You can't see it so you'll have to believe me. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The first multi-player interface I'm making is an iPhone app, so it
      loads the city, and it lets you zoom and run over it. And I'm just
      about to hook it up to the server, so you can come into the game as a
      helicopter, and just tilt to run around, and then just chat. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually I want to do the whole game on the iPhone, Andriod and
      whatever else. The first step is to just get presence and chatting in
      there.
    </p>

    <p>
      One interesting thing: This is 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Version_3" target="_new">GPLv3</a>.
      So you can't put it on the iPhone on purpose, because of the 
      anti-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoization" target="_new">TiVoization</a>
      clause. But it's ok though to have it running on the server. And I think it's more
      interesting to have it running on the server, and anyway there's
      already a SimCity that runs on the iPhone.

    <p>
      Any questions?

    <p>
      Q: What's the cheat code to get money? 
    </p>

    <p>
      Mike: War!
    </p>

    <p>
      Don: That's what churches are for.
    </p>

    <p>
      I encourage you to script your own church and plug it in. I'm totally
      going to have the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster" target="_new">Flying Spaghetti Monster</a>,
      and he's going to actually convert all the other churches to
      Flying Spaghetti Monster churches, so it will be a moot point,
      and there will be no war.
    </p>

    <p>
      Announcer: Please thank Mr. Hopkins for his nice solution to the
      traffic problem.

Micropolis Core Engine
By Will Wright and Don Hopkins

[TODO: Write documentation here.]

Here are some notes about hooking up a user interface. 

In general, the philosophy is to tell the scriptinging engine that something has changed by sending a callback message out, without any parameters. 
(The code may not currently be doing that, but that's how it should work.)
Then the script handler can pull the parameters out of the simulator itself, instead of being passed the parameters in the callback. 
This is so that the script can delay updating until the next time it paints the screen, consolidating a bunch of changes into one refresh. 
That avoides the overhead of converting and formatting values that don't end up getting used. 
Also, we want to defer all formatting to the scripting language, instead of formatting in the core simulator, so the script can internationalize the numbers and text. 
Likewise, the simulator should not have any strings hard wired into it -- all those should be looked up by the scripting language, in translation files. 
To conserve power on the OLPC, the script might want to schedule an update at the next round timer tick, so all the updates happen at once. 

Parts of the simulator that update the user interface:

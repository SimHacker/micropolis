/**
 * Class for storing effects of applying a tool to the world.
 *
 * When applying a tool, two things change:
 *  - The world map.
 *  - The funds of the player.
 *  - Messages sent to the player and the front-end.
 *  - Sounds played for the player.
 *
 * The funds gives a decision problem. To decide whether the tool can be
 * applied, you need to know the cost. To know the cost you need to know the
 * exact changes being made.
 * The simplest way to compute the exact changes is to simply apply the tool to
 * the world. This holds especially when tools get stacked on top of each
 * other.
 *
 * This class provides an easy way out, greatly simplifying the problem.
 * All tools do not modify the world directly, but instead put their results
 * in an instance of this class, thus collecting all the modifications.
 * After the whole operation is 'done', the #ToolEffects instance can tell the
 * precise cost and what has been changed in the world. At that moment, the
 * yes/no decision can be made, and the effects can be copied to the real map
 * and funds.
 *
 * @todo Extend the class for storing messages and sounds.

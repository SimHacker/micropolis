Micropolis City Simulation Algorithm Description.

SimFrame

  If SimSpeed is 0, then return.

  Increment Spdcycle mod 1024.
  
  If SimSpeed is 1, then return every 4 out of 5 frames.

  If SimSpeed is 2, then return every 2 out of 3 frames.

  Increment Fcycle mod 1024.

  Call Simulate, passing the phase parameter of (Fcycle mod 16).


Simulate

  Passed the phase parameter, which switches through 16 phases (0 to 15).

  Phase 0:
    Increment Scycle and wrap mod 1024.
    If DoInitialEval:
      Clear DoInitialEval.
      Call CityEvaluation.
    Increment CityTime.
    Increase AvCityTax by CityTax.
    If Scycle is even:
      Call SetValves.
    Call ClearCensus.

  Phase 1:
    Call MapScan on 1st 8th of map.

  Phase 2:
    Call MapScan on 2nd 8th of map.

  Phase 3:
    Call MapScan on 3rd 8th of map.

  Phase 4:
    Call MapScan on 4th 8th of map.

  Phase 5:
    Call MapScan on 5th 8th of map.

  Phase 6:
    Call MapScan on 6st 8th of map.

  Phase 7:
    Call MapScan on 7st 8th of map.

  Phase 8:
    Call MapScan on 8st 8th of map.

  Phase 9:
    If CityTime mod CENSUSRATE is 0:
      Call TakeCensus.
    If CityTime mod (CENSUSRATE * 12) is 0:
      Call Cake2Census.
    If CityTime mod TAXFREQ is 0:
      Call CollectTax.
      Call CityEvaluation.

  Phase 10:
    If Scycle mod 5 is 0:
      Call DecROGMem.
    Call DecTrafficMem.
    Set NewMapFlags for TDMAP, RDMAP, ALMAP, REMA, COMAP, INMAP, DYMAP.
    Call SendMessages.

  Phase 11:
    If Scycle mod SpdPwr[SimSpeed] is 0:
      Call DoPowerScan.
      Set NewMapFlags for PRMAP.
      Set NewPower.

  Phase 12:
    If Scycle mod SpdPtl[SimSpeed] is 0:
      Call PTLScan. (Pollution, Terrain, Land Value.)

  Phase 13:
    If Scycle mod SpdCri[SimSpeed] is 0:
      Call CrimeScan.

  Phase 14:
    If Scycle mod SpdPop[SimSpeed] is 0:
      Call PopDenScan.

  Phase 15:
    If Scycle mod SpdFir[SimSpeed] is 0:
      Call FireAnalysis.
    Call DoDisasters.

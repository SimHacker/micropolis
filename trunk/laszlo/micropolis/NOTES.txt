Notes on the client/server tile engine:

  Animated tiles

    The client tells the server a list of its views, each with the
    bounding box of the tiles it's displaying. 

    The coordinates are in pixel coordinates (i.e. tiles are 16x1), so
    the server can tell other clients where this client is looking in
    pixel coordinates, and figure out the exact tiles using the same
    rounding algorithm as the client.

    The client can send a "reset" command to the server to flush its
    cache of the client state, in case it gets out of sync or
    reconnects. (TODO)

    The server keeps track of the tiles in the client's buffer (which
    is filled lazily). It maps all tiles in an animation group to the
    lowest tile number tile of that group. The server does not care 
    which tile of an animation loop or sequence the client is displaying,
    because the client animates the tiles, to reduces network traffic by
    not sending all the tile animation changes. 

    Tiles in the animation set are displayed in at least one of the
    views the client told the server about, so they should be lazily
    animated once every time one or more ticks pass, and the client
    displays one or more views.

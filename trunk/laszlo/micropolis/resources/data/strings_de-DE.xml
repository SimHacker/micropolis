    <!--

        This XML file defines all the strings in Micropolis,
	for specific languages.

	The "strings_en-US.xml" file is considered the master file.
	It is used as a template for the other languages.
	In order to add a string, first add it to the "en-US" file,
	then use the web "/server/getTranslations" web interface to
	update the other language strings from the "en-US" strings.
	That will add any new strings in place, and mark them as 
	needing to be translated, with at-signs like "@nl-NL".
	Then you can use the web interface to translate the
	strings into other languages.

	The top level <strings> element should have a language attribute, 
	which specifies the language of the translated strings. 

	Each <string> sub-element has an id attribute, 
	which is the name by which the string is refered in the code.
	The ID can be the string itself in English, 
	possibly abbreviated with a "*" at the end, 
	or it may be a logical name called out by the code. 
	Some string elements have an optional comment attribute,
	which tells the translator how to deal with the string.
	Each string element contains utf-8 unicode text, 
	which is the translated string. 

	Strings should not contain any markup as actual tags. Any
	markup or entities to be displayed as html in the user
	interface should be escaped.
